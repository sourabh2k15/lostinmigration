It is a fun,simple javascript game which checks your presence of mind and attention skills. It has 2 modes. Just get a gold cup in the time mode in your 1st attempt and you can definitely brag of something true you would have achieved :). Beware of the illusions the birds create .

It was my first javascript game and this is my first github repo .
