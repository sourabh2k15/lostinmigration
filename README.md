it is a fun,simple javascript game which checks your presence of mind and attention skills . it has 2 modes . just get a gold cup in the time mode in your 1st attempt and you can definitely brag of something true you would have achieved :) .beware of the illusions the birds create .

it was my first javascript game and this is my first github repo .
